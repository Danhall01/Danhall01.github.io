Necrocade is a game created by 2 students over one LP (half semester) as part of a course in BTH.

For this project I created the entire LUA infastructure as well as some of the gameplay mechanics. The game was primarily a way to learn ESC and how to connect scripting languaged together with C/C++.

The project is currently a bit cryptic on how to build, however instructions will be added in the near future.
