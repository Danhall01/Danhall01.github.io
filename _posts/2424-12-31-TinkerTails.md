Created by a group of 12 students over the span of one semester as part of the course "Big Game Project" in BTH.

This project is curently ongoing and I am responsible for the entire LUA infastructure as well as future optimisation and profiling of the game. One of my goals in this game is to implement compression in networking and textures so we don't have to worry about file/package sizes in the final product.
