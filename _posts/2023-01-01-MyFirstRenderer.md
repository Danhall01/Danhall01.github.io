My first renderer. This project was created as part of a course in BTH and contains features such as `deferred rendering`, `billboarding`, `normal mapping`, `LOD`, `cube mapping`, `lights` (point, directional), `shadow mapping`, `obj-parsing`, `quad-tree culling`, among many others.
Although featuring a lot of features, the renderer is rather slow as it was my first renderer ever created.
