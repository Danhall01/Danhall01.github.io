Whisperwoods is a game which was created by a group of 6 students over the span of 6 weeks as part of a course in BTH.

My role in this game was optimisation and making sure that the game could run with at least 30 fps on 1080p on a 2014 Intel NUC. The NUC had an integrated graphics card and suffered from depricated software. The techniques applied were all specialised towards making the game run as smmothly as possible on the target hardware, even though it slowed down the game on "normal" hardware.

I was responsible for many of the techniqes shown in the game trailer below. Primarily I implemented baked shadow mapping and a forward+ pre render pass. I was also behind the idea of the grouped instanced rendering.
