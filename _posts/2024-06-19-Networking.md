A project which explores linux sockets and signals and uses them to send html packages over a network. This is then performed both with a threaded approach as well as a forked one. These two variants of the same program are then profiled and messured to then draw conclusions how which one is prefered at what point. The pdf with the performance analysis can be found in the github repository.

Github link will be up in a few days whenever I have time to rework the repository.
