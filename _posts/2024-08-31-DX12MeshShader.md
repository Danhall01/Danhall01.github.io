This is an ongoing project for a course in BTH which has the student explore a feature of DX12 and compare it to an implementation in DX11.

For this project I first wanted to look at `work graphs` however with insufficient hardware I decided to look into mesh shaders and compare them to the traditional geometry shader pipeline.


No github link as of right now as this is an ongoing project.
